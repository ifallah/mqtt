===============
MQTT iOS Sample is an application that provides a user the ability to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics from their iOS device.

This project depends on the iOS MQTT Client library included in the [IBM WebSphere Mobile Messaging and M2M Client Pack](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/c565c720-fe84-4f63-873f-607d87787327/entry/download?lang=en). 
Setup
-----
After downloading the client pack from the link above, unzip it and go to `SDK/clients/iOS/` and copy `libiosMQTT.a` and `MqttOCClient.h` into your XCode project.

Once the files have been added to the project, ensure that they are included in the `Library Search Paths` and `Header Search Paths` properties of the project. These properties can be found by selecting the project in XCode and going to `Build Settings`.
